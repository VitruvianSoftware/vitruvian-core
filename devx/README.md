## Mission Statement

**devx** exists to bring absolute joy back to local development. 
We relentlessly eliminate the daily friction that pulls developers out of their flow state. From wrestling with inconsistent OS kernels to manually managing `.env` files, mocking webhooks, or resetting scrambled testing databases—we believe your tooling should work natively, instantly, and invisibly so you can just write code.

## Why `devx`? (More than just Compose or Skaffold)

While tools like **Docker Compose** excel at booting containers and **Skaffold** focuses on bridging local code to Kubernetes clusters, `devx` serves as a comprehensive, end-to-end **Local Development Environment Orchestrator**. 

We go far beyond basic container networking by natively integrating the premium capabilities developers usually pay for or duct-tape together into a single, unified CLI:

### Local Infrastructure
* 🔑 **Vault-Native Config Sync:** Stop DMing `.env` files. `devx` connects to 1Password, Bitwarden, or GCP Secret Manager to automatically inject secrets natively directly into process environments.
* 🌱 **Automated Database Seeding:** Dynamically injects connection strings & legacy fragments (`devx db seed`) from running containers directly into your native Node.js/Go seed scripts.
* 🛠️ **Frictionless Resilience:** Built-in automatic Port-Shifting transparently overrides `EADDRINUSE` conflicts, and native `devx` crash-tailing instantly pinpoints startup failures precisely inline.
* 🖥️ **Integrated Developer Tools:** We ship with native Bubble Tea TUIs for multiplexed log streaming, webhook HTTP request caching/replay, instant DB state snapshotting, and more.

### Networking & Edge
* 🌐 **Instant Public Ingress:** Stop paying for ngrok. We securely wire your local containers to the internet instantly via Cloudflare Tunnels (`*.ipv1337.dev`), right out of the box.
* 🔒 **Zero-Trust Corporate Access:** Stop fighting with heavy VPN clients. The `devx` VM natively joins your Tailscale mesh silently, giving your local apps direct access to staging and production databases.
* 🔗 **Hybrid Bridge to Kubernetes:** Declaratively bridge remote K8s services into `devx up` with `runtime: bridge`. Outbound port-forwarding (`bridge_target`) and inbound traffic interception (`bridge_intercept`) participate in the DAG with correct dependency ordering, unified lifecycle, and bridge-native health checks.

### Orchestration & State
* 🚦 **Intelligent Service Orchestration:** Seamless DAG-based `depends_on` startup sequences rivaling Docker Compose and Skaffold, completely eliminating local "Connection Refused" loops.
* ⚡ **Zero-Rebuild Hot Reloading:** Bypass slow VirtioFS volume mounts with intelligent Mutagen-powered file syncing (`devx sync up`) that propagates changes in milliseconds.
* 🌐 **Multirepo Orchestration:** Compose multiple sibling `devx.yaml` files from neighbouring repositories via `include:` directives into a single unified local cluster — with fail-fast conflict detection and automatic working-directory injection per project.

### Testing & Telemetry
* 🧪 **Ephemeral E2E Testing:** Unlike Compose which corrupts your local databases during UI tests, `devx test ui` dynamically clones isolated, randomized copies of your database topology to run Cypress/Playwright tests safely.
* ⏪ **Time-Travel Debugging:** Snapshot and restore complete macro-topology states (RAM, volumes, networks) using CRIU, plus redact-safe diagnostic dumps for frictionless support (`devx state`).
* 📊 **Predictive Pre-Building:** Local telemetry tracks build durations and proactively nudges you when builds degrade. Opt-in background pre-building watches dependency manifests and silently primes container caches so restarts are instant.

### Pipelines & CI/CD
* 🔬 **Local CI Emulation:** Debug your GitHub Actions locally with `devx ci run` — matrix expansion, job DAGs, and parallel execution without the "fix ci" commit loop.
* 🤖 **AI-Native from Day 1:** Fully compliant with AI Agents (Cursor, Claude Code, Gemina) via deterministic `--json` outputs, `--dry-run` safety mechanisms, and native Agent Skill discovery.

`devx` provisions a customized **Fedora CoreOS** VM via your chosen backend (Lima, Colima, Docker, OrbStack, or Podman) and seamlessly drives this entire supercharged ecosystem.

## Quick Start

### Step 0: Check Prerequisites

Run the built-in health check to audit and install prerequisites automatically:

```bash
devx doctor            # check what's installed
devx doctor install    # install missing tools
devx doctor auth       # authenticate required services
```

<details>
<summary>Manual Installation Prerequisites</summary>

| Tool | Install | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| [Podman](https://podman.io) / [Lima](https://lima-vm.io/) / [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) / [Docker](https://docker.com) | | Any VM backend of your choice |
| [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/get-started/) | `brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared` | Cloudflare tunnel daemon |
| [butane](https://coreos.github.io/butane/) | `brew install butane` | Ignition config compiler |
| [gh](https://cli.github.com) | `brew install gh` | GitHub CLI (for `devx sites`) |

</details>

### Step 1: The Magic (TL;DR)

```bash
devx vm init    # One command. Done.
```

You get a fully-configured Fedora CoreOS VM via your chosen provider with:

- 🌐 **Instant public HTTPS** — Your machine gets `your-name.ipv1337.dev` automatically
- 🔒 **Zero-trust corporate access** — The VM joins your Tailnet transparently
- 🚀 **ngrok-like port exposure** — `devx tunnel expose 3000` gives you a public URL in seconds
- 🏗️ **Host-level isolation** — Pre-tuned `inotify` limits, rootful containers, dedicated kernel

### Path A: The Golden Path (Starting a Project)

```bash
# 1. Provision your dev environment
devx vm init

# 2. Generate a pre-wired API (e.g. go-api, node-api)
devx scaffold go-api

# 3. Boot required databases and tunnel mappings
cd new-project
devx up

# 4. Enter the isolated dev container (with AI and secrets injected!)
devx shell
```

### Path B: The 'ngrok' Alternative

If you just want to punch a secure hole through to an app running on your Macbook right now:

```bash
# 1. Start your local application natively
npm run dev # (running on localhost:3000)

# 2. Expose it via Cloudflare Tunnels instantly
devx tunnel expose 3000 --name myapp
# → https://myapp.your-name.ipv1337.dev
```

## Configuration Domains

The `devx` ecosystem separates configuration into two distinct files based on the scope of orchestration:

1. **`devx.yaml` (Project-Level Local Dev):** This is the primary configuration file. It lives in your application's repository and defines the local development topology (databases, tunnels, CI steps, and dependent services). It is used by almost all `devx` commands (e.g., `devx up`, `devx test`, `devx action`).
2. **`homelab.yaml` (Infrastructure-Level Cluster Dev):** This file is exclusively used by the `devx homelab` command suite. It defines the desired state of a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster (node IPs, K3s versions, VM allocations) and is usually kept in a dedicated infrastructure repository.

These files do not override each other; they serve completely different domains.

## Design Principles

- **One CLI, everything** — VM, tunnels, databases, agent skills, and site hosting are all subcommands of `devx`.
- **Convention over configuration** — Sensible defaults, but everything is overridable.
- **Transparency & Idempotency** — Destructive operations show an impact summary. Commands are designed to be run repeatedly safely.
- **AI-native** — Agent skill files and `--json` output make `devx` controllable by AI coding assistants.
- **CLI + YAML parity** — Every configurable behavior is available both as a CLI flag and as a `devx.yaml` property.
- **Optimized Inner Loop** — Developer flow state is sacred. Every feature is optimized to radically reduce cycle time.
- **Client-Side First Architecture** — No bloated centralized SaaS proxy servers required. `devx` runs completely locally.
- **Absolute Portability** — "It works on my machine" is solved permanently. Because `devx` standardizes a VM locally, execution topology is indistinguishable regardless of your host OS.
