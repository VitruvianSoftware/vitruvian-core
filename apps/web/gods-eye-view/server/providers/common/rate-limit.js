 * Opt-in per-IP rate limiter for the cost-bearing API proxies (OpenAI / Google).
 * DEFAULT IS UNLIMITED: when the env var is unset, `0`, or non-numeric, this
 * returns `null` and the caller skips the check entirely — a runtime no-op that
 * preserves the original behavior. Only a positive integer N enables a fixed
 * 60s window of N requests/IP (built lazily once, then reused so its per-IP
 * window state persists across requests). The global backstop is set to a
 * generous multiple of the per-IP cap so a single host can't starve the rest.
 *
 * @param {string|undefined} envValue - Raw env value (requests/min/IP).
 * @returns {((key:string)=>boolean)|null} An `allow(key)` fn, or null when unlimited.
